# Prototyping Products â€“ Portfolio

This repository showcases interactive prototypes developed during the *Prototyping Products* course at ESADE. The projects combine design, large language models (LLMs), and real-world problem solving using Streamlit.
## Projects

### Cruz Verde Pharmacy Assistant (LLM Prototype)
An LLM-based prototype where the model (Cohere) interprets user symptoms and recommends medications. The system combines LLM output with a local product dataset, filters valid options, and displays details like price and manufacturer. It reflects key course concepts such as prompt refinement, post-processing, and integration with external data sources.

- Technologies: Streamlit, Cohere API, Python, Dataset Matching, WhatsApp Integration

### Hotel Booking Insights (Streamlit Prototype)
An interactive Streamlit app built around a cancellation prediction model. More than just predictions, it offers filters, data visualizations, and user controls to explore customer behavior and booking trends.

- Technologies: Streamlit, Python, scikit-learn, joblib, Plotly
